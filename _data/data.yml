  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    I have received the B.S. and M.S. degrees
    from the University of Science and Technology at
    Hanoi (USTH), Vietnam. I'm currently pursuing
    the Ph.D. degree at the Astroparticle and Cosmol-
    ogy Laboratory (APC), Université Paris Cité, Paris,
    France, which he started in December 2023. My
    research focuses on the impact of flicker noise on
    the design methodology of SiGe BiCMOS integrated
    circuits for astronomical observations. I'm also a
    member of the R&T BiCMOS Project

       - Topic: High Sensitive On-Chip BiMOS Thermometer with Differential readout and Offset Nulling
      This is the Master 2 thesis. Study the state of the art of "on-chip" thermometry techniques, specially studying the AD590 thermometer as an existing example. Then establish a trade-offs between technology, supply voltage, power consumption and sensitivity of the design of such an "on-chip" thermometer.

      - Topic: Light Sensitive Photon Sensor SiPM
      During the project, my main work is study the properties of the Silicon Photon-multiplier (SiPMs) and do the experiment with SiPMs readout circuit to understand the signal then be able to change its shape. During the internship, we are also able to use the LTspice analog simulation software to simulate the SiPMs, combined with the readout circuit and then provide the simulated signal.

      - Topic: Image noise and Aberration simulation for astrophotography with Ground-Based Telescope
      This is the Bachelor thesis. During the project, my main work is study different types of noises and aberration effect happened during astrophotography process. Noises often came from the capturing, transferring and reading process of the CCD. Beside of that, the aberration came from the curvature of the lens and the structure of the system. My work is to simulate these effect using the Matlab language and Matlab GUI interface.

      - Topic: Cosmic Ray Muon study for imaging the hiddenstructure
      This is the group project of B3 Class, which acts like a prototype for student to prepare their skill before the internship and the final thesis. During the project, my main work is study the nature of Muon particles and its application in radiographyfor imaging the hidden structure. Our team has a chance to studied do some experiments relate to Muon counters such as counting the dark count rate (DCR) with Nuclear Instrumentation Module (NIM) board, discriminator and dual timer and using the generated data using the DRS4 board

    tagline: "This IN2P3 R&T project compares available BiCMOS technologies to identify a sustainable and affordable option for high-performance, front-end analog electronics. While many ASICs move to full CMOS, BiCMOS remains essential for low-noise (astronomy) and high-dynamic-range (medical) needs. The project aims to establish figures of merit and streamline future ASIC developments in space, astro, nuclear, and medical applications."
