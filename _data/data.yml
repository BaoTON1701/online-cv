  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    I have received the B.S. and M.S. degrees
    from the University of Science and Technology at
    Hanoi (USTH), Vietnam. I'm currently pursuing
    the Ph.D. degree at the Astroparticle and Cosmology Laboratory (APC), Université Paris Cité, Paris,
    France, which I started in December 2023. My
    research focuses on the impact of flicker noise on
    the design methodology of SiGe BiCMOS integrated
    circuits for astronomical observations. I'm also a
    member of the R&T BiCMOS Project

      Topic: Flicker Noise Impact on the Design Methodology of SiGe BiCMOS Integrated Circuits for Astronomical Observations
      - PhD research focused on analyzing and mitigating flicker noise in SiGe BiCMOS front-end electronics for cryogenic ASIC readouts (SQUID/TES). This involves the complete design, simulation (using Cadence Virtuoso), and characterization of ultra-low-noise components, including LNAs, current sources, and on-chip thermometers. The project includes noise, thermal, and radiation testing to improve the reliability of space-based astronomical instruments (e.g., ATHENA X-IFU).
  - role: Master 2's Internship
    time: March 2023 - September 2023
    company: Labo APC, Bâtiment Condorcet, 10 rue A. Domon et L. Duquet, 75013, Paris, France
    details: |
      Topic: High-Sensitivity On-Chip BiMOS Thermometer with Differential Readout and Offset Nulling
      - For my Master 2 thesis, I studied the state-of-the-art of "on-chip" thermometry techniques, specifically analyzing the AD590 thermometer as an existing example. My work established the trade-offs between technology, supply voltage, power consumption, and sensitivity for the design of a new "on-chip" thermometer.
  - role: Master 1's Internship 
    time: July 2022 to August 2022
    company: International Centre for Interdisciplinary Science and Education (ICISE)
    details: |
      Topic: Characterization and Simulation of Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs)
      - My main work was to study the properties of Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) and conduct experiments with their readout circuits to understand and shape the output signal. I also used LTspice analog simulation software to model the SiPMs and their associated readout circuits, providing a complete simulated signal chain.
  - role: Bachelor's Internship 
    time: April 2021 - July 2021
    company: Vietnam National Space Center (VNSC)
    details: |
      Topic: Image Noise and Aberration Simulation for Astrophotography with a Ground-Based Telescope
      - For my Bachelor thesis, my main work was to study the different types of noise and aberration effects that occurred during the astrophotography process. These noises often originated from the CCD's capturing, transferring, and reading processes. Additionally, aberrations stemmed from lens curvature and system structure. My responsibility was to simulate these effects using MATLAB and the MATLAB GUI interface.
  - role: Bachelor's Group Project 
    time: December 2020 to February 2021
    company: University of Science and Technology at Hanoi (USTH)
    details: |
      Topic: Cosmic Ray Muon Study for Imaging Hidden Structures
      - My main work was to study the nature of Muon particles and their application in radiography for imaging hidden structures. Our team conducted experiments related to Muon counters, such as counting the dark count rate (DCR) using a Nuclear Instrumentation Module (NIM) board, discriminator, and dual timer. We then analyzed the data generated from a DRS4 board.

    tagline: "This IN2P3 R&T project compares available BiCMOS technologies to identify a sustainable and affordable option for high-performance, front-end analog electronics. While many ASICs move to full CMOS, BiCMOS remains essential for low-noise (astronomy) and high-dynamic-range (medical) needs. The project aims to establish figures of merit and streamline future ASIC developments in space, astro, nuclear, and medical applications."
